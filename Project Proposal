Through our project we aim to build a mathematical model describing the range-shift of Calanus finmarchicus over time in response to changing ocean temperatures. It is well known that climate change has affected ocean temperatures globally, causing a multitude of behavioral changes in a vast number of species which depend on zooplankton as a source of food. Creating a model showing how the upper and lower latitudinal bounds of historical measurements have changed and comparing this to ocean temperature data will allow for better analysis of correlation and potential causation. We think that exploring whether climate change has had an effect on the presence of zooplankton will allow for better insight when attempting to predict how changing ocean temperatures may affect the presence and behaviors of the wider marine ecosystem.
